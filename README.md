Building upon our vision for the future, we propose the following three questions:

Q1: The form of AGI is individual intelligence or collective intelligence? Our choice is collective intelligence

Q2: The robots we send to Mars—will they be humanoid robots like Optimus, or a swarm of machine systems?

Q3: In the era of robotics, how should we design robots? If we can take inspiration from biological forms, can we similarly generate robot designs automatically based on contextual needs?

Based on these considerations, we aim to bring some concepts into reality，hence we are named Machine Society.
